# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
You will submit the following:

Deliverable 1: A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
Deliverable 2: A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type
Deliverable 3: A written report for the PyBer analysis (README.md)
## Results
As seen in the dataframe below, pyber_summary_df shows that there are more drivers in the urban cities than both suburban and rural combined.Also Urban cities also generated more in fares than suburban and rural combined. Lastly, Urban cities had the lowest average fare per ride at $24.53.

## Summary
After analyzing the data of the different city types and their variables therein (total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type) we have determined the following:
    * while urban cities having the highest demand, advertising in these areas would potentially be the most effective.
    * Rural cities charge the highest average fare, but generate the least amount of revenue. Pyber should consider not priortizing rural cities for expansion.
    * All cities saw a spike of revenue towards the end of February
    * Urban cities only had enough rides for 67% of drivers to get 1 ride. Would be recommended to cut drivers to maximize porifts
